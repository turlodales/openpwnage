# openpwnage
Open source iOS 8.4b4-9.3.6 32bit Semi-Untethered jailbreak

## Notice

iOS 9 patchfinder is by spv, iOS 8 patchfinder (not on this repo) by dora2-iOS. Please give thanks to them. And, unless this is the only jailbreak supported for your device, you should use other jailbreaks like p0laris. This isn't the best coded and p0laris is much better coded. This notice will later be ported to iOS and future posts about openpwnage. Also please head to [https://github.com/0xilis/openpwnage](https://github.com/0xilis/openpwnage), this is the current repo.

# Special Note:

Please back up first before trying openpwnage.

## Future:

I'm trying to get openpwnage beta 10 ASAP. Unfortunately I no longer have the time I used to to develop openpwnage, but openpwnage beta 10 is pretty close to done already so hopefully it still should release soon-ish.

changes will include:
- will display warning to use p0laris on 9.3.X A5/A5X, inapp credits etc which i should have done from the beginning
- 4 themes (Classic, Classic Dark, Solar and Blossom)
- barebones launch screen
- swap back to old bootstrap because new is having issues on iOS 9
- actual error messages with patchfinding
- 9.0-9.2.1 bugfix

not included in beta 10, but latr:
- iOS 10.3.X support, mayb 10.X latr
- Rewrite spv's segments of iOS 9 patchfinder, and everything else from p0laris with my own, not sure if I'll do this all in one update or over time. (I guess I could replace with stuff from MIT projects? But while would be less effort and take faster, even if I'm allowed to I want to start staying away from using other's work).
- better theme customization
- look into iOS 8.3, and latr complete 8.X.
- fix the annoying console view bug
